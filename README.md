### @jujuadams

Library to interface with YouTube's "Data v3" web API. Allows for both "device" and "installed app" authorisation flows. Set up to allow for getting information rather than uploading stuff.

More details here: https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/

**N.B. You will need to provide your own Google OAuth credentials.**

Information on how to do this can be found here: https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials
